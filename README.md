Ex Taedio is a dashboard built using [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/). Its goal is to help the user create plots and visualizations.

## Getting Started

Ex Taedio is available as an heroku app [here](https://extaedio.herokuapp.com/) but you can also build it yourself following these instructions.

### Prerequisites

- Python, at least version 3.6, installed on your computer.
- A navigator.
- Some features, i.e. exporting plot as html, don't work on windows.

### Installing

- Clone the repository at this address: https://github.com/tr31zh/ask_me_polotly
- Move into the created folder
- Create new environment: _python -m venv env_
- Activate environment: _source ./env/bin/activate_
- Clone environment: _pip install -r requirements.txt_
- Run Ex Taedio: _streamlit run sl_plot_me.py_

## Using

- Show help related to plot options will show help extracted from plotly under each plot configuration widget according to the level selected.
- Enable _Show information panels (blue panels with hints and tips)._ if in need of help.
- Advanced functionality is hidden behind the _Advanced mode_ checkbox.
- When advanced mode is active, data wrangling, advanced plots and advanced plot settings can be enabled.

### Basic plots

#### Scatter

    In a scatter plot, each row of `data_frame` is represented by a symbol
    mark in 2D space.

#### Bar

    In a bar plot, each row of `data_frame` is represented as a rectangular
    mark.

#### Histogram

    In a histogram, rows of `data_frame` are grouped together into a
    rectangular mark to visualize the 1D distribution of an aggregate
    function `histfunc` (e.g. the count or sum) of the value `y` (or `x` if
    `orientation` is `'h'`).

#### Violin plot

    In a violin plot, rows of `data_frame` are grouped together into a
    curved mark to visualize their distribution.

#### Box plot - if you must

    In a box plot, rows of `data_frame` are grouped together into a
    box-and-whisker mark to visualize their distribution.

    Each box spans from quartile 1 (Q1) to quartile 3 (Q3). The second
    quartile (Q2) is marked by a line inside the box. By default, the
    whiskers correspond to the box' edges +/- 1.5 times the interquartile
    range (IQR: Q3-Q1), see "points" for other options.

#### PCA (2D)

    **Principal component analysis (2 dimensions)**
    Given a collection of points in two, three, or higher dimensional space,
    a "best fitting" line can be defined as one that minimizes the average squared distance
    from a point to the line. The next best-fitting line can be similarly chosen from
    directions perpendicular to the first. Repeating this process yields an orthogonal
    basis in which different individual dimensions of the data are uncorrelated.
    These basis vectors are called principal components, and several related procedures
    principal component analysis (PCA).

### Advanced plots

#### Scatter 3D

    In a 3D scatter plot, each row of `data_frame` is represented by a
    symbol mark in 3D space.

#### Line

    In a 2D line plot, each row of `data_frame` is represented as vertex of
    a polyline mark in 2D space.

#### Density heat map

    In a density heatmap, rows of `data_frame` are grouped together into
    colored rectangular tiles to visualize the 2D distribution of an
    aggregate function `histfunc` (e.g. the count or sum) of the value `z`.

#### Density contour

    In a density contour plot, rows of `data_frame` are grouped together
    into contour marks to visualize the 2D distribution of an aggregate
    function `histfunc` (e.g. the count or sum) of the value `z`.

#### Parallel categories

    In a parallel categories (or parallel sets) plot, each row of
    `data_frame` is grouped with other rows that share the same values of
    `dimensions` and then plotted as a polyline mark through a set of
    parallel axes, one for each of the `dimensions`.

#### Parallel coordinates

    In a parallel coordinates plot, each row of `data_frame` is represented
    by a polyline mark which traverses a set of parallel axes, one for each
    of the `dimensions`.

#### Scatter matrix

    Plot a scatter mattrix for all selected columns

#### PCA (3D)

    **Principal component analysis (3 dimensions)**
    Given a collection of points in two, three, or higher dimensional space,
    a "best fitting" line can be defined as one that minimizes the average squared distance
    from a point to the line. The next best-fitting line can be similarly chosen from
    directions perpendicular to the first. Repeating this process yields an orthogonal
    basis in which different individual dimensions of the data are uncorrelated.
    These basis vectors are called principal components, and several related procedures
    principal component analysis (PCA).

#### Linear Discriminant Analysis

    A generalization of Fisher's linear discriminant, a method used in statistics,
    pattern recognition, and machine learning to find a linear combination of features
    that characterizes or separates two or more classes of objects or events. The resulting
    combination may be used as a linear classifier, or, more commonly, for dimensionality
    reduction before later classification.

#### Neighborhood Component Analysis

    A supervised learning method for classifying multivariate data into distinct classes
    according to a given distance metric over the data. Functionally, it serves the same
    purposes as the K-nearest neighbors algorithm, and makes direct use of a related concept
    termed stochastic nearest neighbors.

#### Correlation matrix

    Plot correlation matrix

## Deployment

Ex Taedio has been deployed to [Heroku](www.heroku.com). At the moment of writing this readme the deployment can be done with the wizard in heroku's dashboard.

## Built With
